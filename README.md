This is an R Shiny application developed to perform a Productivity-Susceptability risk analysis.  It extends the existing methodology of Patrick et al (2009) by providing the ability to assign a probability value to each score for each attribute. These score probabilities are combined to define a vulnerability likelihood function. This alternate methodology and shiny application were developed by Dr Nathan Vaughan of Vaughan Analytics supporting NOAA's Southeast Fisheries Science Center in collaboration with Dr Jason Cope of NOAA's Northwest Fisheries Science Center. Please contact nathan.vaughan@noaa.gov with any questions. The application is hosted at  https://nathan-vaughan.shinyapps.io/psa_shiny/
